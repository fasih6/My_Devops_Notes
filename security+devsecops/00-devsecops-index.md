# DevSecOps — Index & Learning Path

## What Is DevSecOps?

DevSecOps integrates security practices into every stage of the software development lifecycle (SDLC) rather than treating security as a final gate before release. The core idea is **shift-left** — move security checks earlier in the pipeline so issues are caught when they are cheapest to fix.

```
Traditional:  Dev → Dev → Dev → QA → Security → Ops  (security is a bottleneck)
DevSecOps:    Dev+Sec → Dev+Sec → Dev+Sec → QA+Sec → Ops+Sec  (security is embedded)
```

## Why It Matters for Interviews

DevSecOps is one of the fastest-growing specialisations in the DevOps/Cloud space. Companies ask about it because:
- Cloud-native architectures have large attack surfaces (containers, APIs, IAM)
- Compliance requirements (GDPR, SOC2, ISO27001) require demonstrable security controls
- Supply-chain attacks (Log4Shell, SolarWinds) made dependency security critical
- Kubernetes clusters are frequently misconfigured and exploited

## Recommended Learning Order

1. **Start with core concepts** — understand the threat landscape and OWASP Top 10 before tooling
2. **Secrets management** — most impactful, commonly asked in interviews, high real-world value
3. **Container security** — essential since everything runs in containers now
4. **SAST + SCA** — how to integrate scanning into a pipeline
5. **IaC security** — especially if you know Terraform already
6. **Kubernetes security** — builds on the K8s knowledge you already have
7. **Pipeline integration** — tie everything together in CI/CD
8. **DAST + runtime** — advanced, differentiator in senior interviews
9. **Compliance** — important for Germany/EU roles

## Key Concepts Quick Reference

| Concept | One-line definition |
|---------|-------------------|
| Shift-left | Move security checks earlier in the SDLC |
| SAST | Scan source code without executing it |
| DAST | Test a running application from the outside |
| SCA | Scan third-party dependencies for CVEs |
| SBOM | Software Bill of Materials — inventory of all components |
| CVE | Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures — public vuln database |
| CVSS | Severity score for vulnerabilities (0–10) |
| Least privilege | Grant only the minimum permissions needed |
| Zero trust | Never trust, always verify — even internal traffic |
| Policy-as-code | Security rules defined in code, enforced automatically |

## Relevance for Germany / EU Roles

- **GDPR** — data residency, PII handling, right to erasure affect architecture decisions
- **BSI (Bundesamt für Sicherheit in der Informationstechnik)** — German federal cybersecurity agency, sets standards many companies follow
- **NIS2 Directive** — EU-wide cybersecurity regulation that came into effect 2024, affects critical infrastructure
- **ISO 27001** — common compliance requirement in German enterprise, especially automotive, finance, healthcare
